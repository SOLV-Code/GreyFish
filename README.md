# GreyFish: A Portal to Agency-Published Fisheries Literature 
**(Now also covering Interactive Fisheries/Oceanography Apps!)**

Welcome to GreyFish. Check out the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/GreyFish/wiki) for a user guide,
search portal, and further reading.

### Purpose

Our motivation for creating this site is twofold:

First, we want to build a resource for scientometric analyses of publications 
with a different kind of impact factor: Much of this material is developed 
in response to specific questions from managers or policy makers, and 
directly influences the operational decisions made in fisheries agencies. 
Patterns in these publications, such as the persistent increase in the 
number of authors per report, reflect the day-to-day working environment 
of the scientists tasked with providing advice on the management of fisheries.

Second, we want to facilitate access to this vast body of work and encourage 
its use. A portal like GreyFish helps to reduce the oft-lamented fragmentation
 of knowledge, and as with all information resources, there's an element
 of "use it or loose it". This is especially relevant in our age of 
 digital publishing, when an entire catalogue of agency publications 
 can go offline in a blink of an eye, and may not come back 
 (e.g. during a departmental reorganization)

### Contents
Towards both of these ends, GreyFish includes:

* [DATA](DATA/): datasets of grey literature(i.e. citations, with links where available) and interactive apps (categorized by topic and focus)
* [SEARCH / CONTEXT](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/GreyFish/wiki/2-Search-Portal): Search Portal and links to background information about different report series (e.g. review process)
* [FUNCTIONS](FUNCTIONS/): custom R functions used in the analyses 
* [SCRIPTS](SCRIPTS/):  R code that applies the custom functions
* [RESULTS](RESULTS/): summaries of observed patterns, and associated presentations/posters/papers

### Status Update 

GreyFish currently covers:

* **18,284** reports published since 1959 by 6 agencies from 4 countries,
 spread over 41 report series.
*  **65** interactive online applications (mostly in *Shiny*)
