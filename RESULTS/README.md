### Taxonomy of Online Apps

Recent software developments make it possible for marine scientists to 
build powerful and robust interactive applications with a minimum of 
web-specific programming skills. For example, the Shiny extension of 
the widely used R language automatically 
handles most of the challenges that used to be major obstacles to 
implementation (e.g. browser and operating system compatibility, 
adjusting layouts for device screen size). However, most 
applications to-date do not use the full potential of these new tools. 

We are compiling an inventory of online apps for fisheries and oceanography to 
identify patterns in what's currently available, and priorities
for future app development.

Here is an overview of our current data set:
