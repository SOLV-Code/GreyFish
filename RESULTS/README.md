### Taxonomy of Online Apps

Recent software developments make it possible for marine scientists to 
build powerful and robust interactive applications with a minimum of 
web-specific programming skills. For example, the Shiny extension of 
the widely used R language automatically 
handles most of the challenges that used to be major obstacles to 
implementation (e.g. browser and operating system compatibility, 
adjusting layouts for device screen size). However, most 
applications to-date do not use the full potential of these new tools. 

We are compiling an inventory of online apps for fisheries and oceanography to 
identify patterns in what's currently available, and priorities
for future app development.

The plot below has an overview of our current data set.

### Scientometric Patterns in Grey Fisheries Literature

Patterns in scientific activity have been studied extensively, 
culminating in scientometrics as a distinct discipline. We check whether some 
empirical laws of scientometrics, based mainly on primary publications, 
also apply to the body of work produced by fisheries agencies.

Overall trends are ([Price 1986](http://derekdesollaprice.org/little-science-big-science-full-text/),
 [Rigler and Peters 1995](https://www.int-res.com/articles/eebooks/eebook06.pdf)):

* The size of science (people, journals, papers) has doubled every 10-20 years for the last 300 years, 
at roughly twice the rate of population growth, so that over 85% of all scientists that ever worked are 
 still active and the body of literature increases tenfold over the course of 
 a professional career. 
* About 25% of the researchers contribute 75% of the published materials, and more recent papers tend to have
 more authors spanning more specialties.
 

The plot below shows the change in author numbers across all records in our current data set.
