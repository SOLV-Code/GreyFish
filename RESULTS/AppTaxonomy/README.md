# Taxonomy of Online Apps


## App Type

We assigned each app in the [inventory](../../DATA/OnlineApplications/) to
one of 5 categories:

**Data Focused** | **Model Focused**
-- | --
Data Portal | General Model
Data Vis     | Model Documentation
             | Analytical Tool

These categories are defined as:
*Data Portal: mainly focused on providing access to one ore more data sets
*Data Vis: includes data and various ways of displaying the data
* General Model: illustrates a basic model or concept  (e.g. fish growth equation)
* Model Documentation: documents the settings, assumptions, or results from a specific analysis 
* Analytical Tool:  allows users to load in their own data and implement analyses


The figure below shows the number of apps in the current inventory, separating data vs. model focused apps.

### Component Scores

Many of the apps have multiple features, and span several of the categories. 
To capture this diversity, we assigned subjective scores 1-5 according to the following
 rough qualitative scales:
 
 **App Feature** | **Score = 1**  | **Score = 5** 
-- | --
Data Portal |  One or a few  data sets, localized |  many datasets, or large scope
Data Vis   |  a few basic plots      |  several interactive variations, innovative plots
General Model | very basic model concept  |  highly specialized complex model
Model Documentation |  general illustration of a method | detailed results, interactive assumption testing
 Analytical Tool    | try out some alternative settings | load in your own data, full functionality


Some examples to illustrate the scoring approach:

 **App** | **DP Score**  | **DV Score** | **GM Score** | **MD Score** | **AT Score** 
-- | -- | --| --| --| --
Basic Predator/Prey Relationship teaching aid | 0  | 0  | 5 | 0  | 0
