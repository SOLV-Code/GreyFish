# Taxonomy of Online Apps


## App Type

We assigned each app in the [inventory](../../DATA/OnlineApplications/) to
one of 5 categories:

**Data Focused**
* Data Portal: mainly focused on providing access to one ore more data sets
* Data Vis: includes data and various ways of displaying the data

**Model Focused**
* General Model: illustrates a basic model or concept  (e.g. fish growth equation)
* Model Documentation: documents the settings, assumptions, or results from a specific analysis 
* Analytical Tool:  allows users to load in their own data and implement analyses


The figure below shows the number of apps in the current inventory, separating data vs. model focused apps.
